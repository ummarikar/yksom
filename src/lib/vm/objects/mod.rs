//! This module contains the core SOM objects. Note that there is a fundamental constraint that
//! *must* be obeyed by the programmer at all times: upon their creation, instances of the `Obj`
//! trait must immediately be passed to `Val::from_obj`. In other words this is safe:
//!
//! ```rust,ignore
//! let x = Val::from_obj(vm, String_{ s: "a".to_owned() });
//! dbg!(x.tobj().as_str());
//! ```
//!
//! but this leads to undefined behaviour:
//!
//! ```rust,ignore
//! let x = String_{ s: "a".to_owned() };
//! dbg!(x.tobj().as_str());
//! ```
//!
//! The reason for this is that methods on `Obj`s can call `Val::restore` which converts an `Obj`
//! reference back into a `Val`.
//!
//! Although this constraint is not enforced through the type system, it is not hard to obey: as
//! soon as you create an `Obj` instance, pass it to `Val::from_obj`.
